It killed people over fourteen countries, and inundated coastal communities with waves up to 30 meters (100 ft) high. With a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3, it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph. The earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between 8.3 and 10 minutes. It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 cm (0.4 inches) and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska. Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia.The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response.

It resulted in the threat of total collapse of large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments, and downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008–2012 global recession and contributing to the European sovereign-debt crisis.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"article-inner-block\">\\n<h2 class=\"article-subtitle\">74.

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to have hit Japan, and the fifth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900. The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 meters (133 ft) in Miyako in Tohoku&#8217;s Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area, traveled up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east and shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), and generated sound waves detected by the low orbiting GOCE satellite.</p>\\n<p class=\"article-inner-description\">The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered US$183 billion to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions. The World Bank&#8217;s estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in world history.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"article-inner-block\">\\n<h2 class=\"article-subtitle\">76.

The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008\\\\u20132012 global recession and contributing to the European sovereign-debt crisis.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n74. Barack Obama Elected as The First Black President of America (2008)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBarack Obama was elected as the president of the United States of America. Barack Obama is the first Afro -American who was elected as the president of the United States of America\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n75. Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami (2011)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn 11th March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami hit the east of Japan, killing over 15,000 and leaving another 9,000 missings. It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to have hit Japan, and the fifth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900. The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 meters (133 ft) in Miyako in Tohoku\\'s Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area, traveled up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east and shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), and generated sound waves detected by the low orbiting GOCE satellite.\\\\r\\\\nThe tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered US$183 billion to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions. The World Bank\\'s estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in world history.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n76. The Death of Osama Bin Laden (2011)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter a decade long search to catch the most wanted criminal on the planet, the pursuit came to an end on May 2 2011, when Osama Bin Laden, the man behind the deadly 9\\\\/11 attacks was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, shortly after 1:00 am local time by a United States special forces military unit. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation by a team of United States Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CIA operatives on the ground\\\\r\\\\n.The raid on bin Laden\\'s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, U.S. forces took bin Laden\\'s body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried it at sea within 24 hours after his death.The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden\\\\u2019s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n77. Nelson Mandela Dies (2013)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn 5 December 2013, Nelson Mandela, the first President of South Africa elected in a fully representative democratic election, died at the age of 95 after suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection. He died at around 20:50 local time (UTC 2) at his home in Houghton, Johannesburg, South Africa, surrounded by his family. South Africa observed a national mourning period of 10 days. During this time numerous memorial services were conducted across the country. The official memorial service was held at FNB Stadium, Johannesburg, on 10 December. His body lay in state at the Union Buildings in Pretoria from 11 to 13 December 2013. A state funeral was held on 15 December 2013 in Qunu in the Eastern Cape province, where his body was buried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n78. Malaysian Airliner MH370 Vanishes Without a Trace (2014)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn what is regarded as the greatest aviation mystery of all time, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing that lost contact with air traffic control on 8 March 2014 at 01:20 MYT, less than an hour after takeoff. At 07:24, Malaysia Airlines reported the flight missing.The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 14 nations. There has been no confirmation of any flight debris and no crash site has been found. A multinational search and rescue effort, later reported as the largest in history,began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea.The search has been laborious with just a few clues to carry on the mission. No debris or body has been found as of now.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"#Publisher\",\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Emlii\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/emlii.com\\\\/wp-content\\\\/uploads\\\\/2020\\\\/10\\\\/Emlii-Logo-2020.png\"}},\"sourceOrganization\":{\"@id\":\"#Publisher\"},\"copyrightHolder\":{\"@id\":\"#Publisher\"},\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/emlii.com\\\\/78-events-across-100-years-that-completely-changed-the-world\\\\/\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"#Breadcrumb\"}},\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Ivana

Indonesia was the hardest-hit country, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. It killed people over fourteen countries, and inundated coastal communities with waves up to 30 meters (100 ft) high. With a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3, it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph. The earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between 8.3 and 10 minutes. It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 cm (0.4 inches) and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska. Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia.The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response. In all, the worldwide community donated more than $14 billion (2004 US$) in humanitarian aid.</p>\n",

In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008–2012 global recession and contributing to the European sovereign-debt crisis.</p>\n",

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to have hit Japan, and the fifth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900. The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 meters (133 ft) in Miyako in Tohoku’s Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area, traveled up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east and shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), and generated sound waves detected by the low orbiting GOCE satellite.</p>\n",

Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered US$183 billion to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions.

The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east and shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), and generated sound waves detected by the low orbiting GOCE satellite.</p>,\n",

The Bank of Japan offered US$183 billion to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions.

       " <p class=\"article-inner-description\">It is considered by many economists the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It resulted in the threat of total collapse of large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments, and downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008–2012 global recession and contributing to the European sovereign-debt crisis.</p>,\n",

       " <p class=\"article-inner-description\">On 11th March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami hit the east of Japan, killing over 15,000 and leaving another 9,000 missings. It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to have hit Japan, and the fifth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900. The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 meters (133 ft) in Miyako in Tohoku’s Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area, traveled up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east and shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), and generated sound waves detected by the low orbiting GOCE satellite.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"article-inner-description\">The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered US$183 billion to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions. The World Bank’s estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in world history.</p>,\n",

The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation by a team of United States Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CIA operatives on the ground</p>,\n",

       " <p class=\"article-inner-description\">In what is regarded as the greatest aviation mystery of all time, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing that lost contact with air traffic control on 8 March 2014 at 01:20 MYT, less than an hour after takeoff. At 07:24, Malaysia Airlines reported the flight missing.The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 14 nations. There has been no confirmation of any flight debris and no crash site has been found.
